## Project: Product Template ##

### Mission Statement: ##

The Product Template in concept is designed to quickly generate website product page content based on a simple workflow. The desired product will likely be a table where information can be entered and a script to arrange that data to generate a webpage.

### Freeform Explanation of Project: ##

The advantage of building a script based algorithm to post product pages has many advantages. Firstly, and most importantly; It allows for a lot of website content to be generated very quickly in an easily understood format. Secondly; the generation of that content can be done by individuals that have little or no experience in web development.

### Proof of Concept: ##

The workflow intended for this product is for a content generation person to fill out a form/table with basic information about a product. (For example)

> Project Title: Product Template
> + This product features
>   * A Simple Interface
>   * Automatic Formatting
>   * No Experience with Web Development Needed

A script will then take this information and format it on to a template and generate 4 image calls (in this case: Product_Template_Logo, Product_Template_001, Product_Template_002, and Product_Template_003). A content generation person/artist will then load images with the generated name to the asset folder and submit the completed product page for review and publication.

### Next Steps: ##

This project is currently in the basic concept phases due to personal inexperience in the space. This template is a representation of my start on the path to becoming a web engineer. There is a long road ahead of me, full of learning and new experiences.

### Possible Future: ##

Execution and publication of this product is not the end of life for this project. At its core, it is designed for content generation, and as such, can be automated.

##### Option 1: ##

The basic information table could be outsourced to a web app. An authorized user could fill out required fields in the web app interface and upload any 4 images. The web app would then format the information into a table and create the image directory.

##### Option 2: ##

(The nuclear option) It is possible to remove human interaction entirely. Using AI, 4 pictures and the information table could be generated from prompts or at random. This is probably only useful as examples or training purposes, but could be useful for exploiting other online platforms.
